Add conditional fields to Elementor forms and apply if-else conditional logic to show or hide Elementor form widget fields via dynamic rules.

== Description ==

**Using Elementor forms but unable to apply conditional logic on form fields?**

The **[Conditional Fields for Elementor Form](https://coolplugins.net/product/conditional-fields-for-elementor-form/?utm_source=cfef_plugin&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=get_pro&utm_content=top_name)** plugin helps you apply **conditional logic** to **Elementor form** fields. You can hide, show, enable, or disable fields dynamically based on input values from other form fields.

Basically, it uses "*If condition*" logic. For example, if condition A is true, then field XYZ will be visible; otherwise, it remains hidden within the Elementor form.

### Conditional Fields Free Features

* **Show / Hide Fields Conditionally**: Easily add conditional logic to show or hide any field within an Elementor form based on values from other fields. You can currently add conditions to these field types: text, textarea, email, telephone, URL, radio, select, file upload, HTML, number, and checkbox.

* **If / Else Logic Without Code**: Apply if/else logic to form fields without writing any code. Simply add the ID of the field on which you want to base the condition. For example, if the "Query Type" field ID is "query_type," you can set it to show the "Enter Order ID" field if `query_type == check-order-status` and hide it otherwise.

* **Apply Multiple Conditions**: Apply multiple conditions to a form field, with actions triggered only if all conditions are met (using AND logic).

* **No Validation Errors**: Avoid validation errors when a required field is hidden due to a condition.

* **Compatibility with Hello Plus**: The Conditional Fields for Elementor Form plugin is fully compatible with the Hello Plus plugin’s Form Lite widget, which you can use inside Elementor Free.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I hide/show or disable/enable Elementor form fields with conditional logic? =
Yes. With the Conditional Fields for Elementor Form plugin, you can [hide or show Elementor form fields](https://docs.coolplugins.net/doc/apply-conditional-logic-on-elementor-form-fields/?utm_source=cfef_plugin&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=docs&utm_content=faqs) based on user input values.

= How can I apply multiple conditions on Elementor form fields? =
You can add multiple conditions to a form field and trigger them using AND/OR logic:

* **OR logic** triggers an action if any one condition is met (available in the [Pro version](https://coolplugins.net/product/conditional-fields-for-elementor-form/?utm_source=cfef_plugin&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=get_pro&utm_content=faqs)).

= Can I redirect an Elementor form to different URLs after submission? =

This feature is available in the Pro version of the addon.

== Installation ==

### Quick Installation

1. Go to **"wp-admin >> Plugins >> Add New"** in your WordPress dashboard, search for **"Conditional Fields for Elementor Form"**, and install and activate the plugin developed by [Cool Plugins](https://coolplugins.net/?utm_source=cfef_plugin&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=author&utm_content=installation).
2. Install **Elementor Pro** to access this plugin’s features, since the Elementor Pro form widget is required.  
   – If you are only using Elementor Free, you can still apply conditional logic by using the **Hello Plus Form Lite widget**.
3. Edit a page with Elementor and create a form. In the Elementor form widget, you’ll find a **Conditions tab** where you can add rules to hide, show, enable, or disable fields. For step-by-step instructions, check the [getting started guide](https://docs.coolplugins.net/doc/apply-conditional-logic-on-elementor-form-fields/?utm_source=cfef_plugin&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=docs&utm_content=installation).

### How to Add Conditional Logic to Elementor Form Fields?

#### Step 1:
First, install **Elementor Pro** (or Hello Plus for Elementor Free), then install **[Conditional Fields for Elementor Form](https://coolplugins.net/product/conditional-fields-for-elementor-form/?utm_source=cfef_plugin&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=get_pro&utm_content=installation)**.  

Since this is an addon for Elementor forms, Elementor Pro or Hello Plus must be installed first.

#### Step 2:
After installation, edit a page with Elementor where you want to add a form. Create the form using the Elementor form widget and add your desired fields.

#### Step 3:
Select the field you want to show, hide, enable, or disable based on conditions.

* **Example:** In a contact form, show the **"Order ID"** field only if the user selects **"Order Status"** in the dropdown, and hide it if **"General Query"** is selected.
* Enable conditions via the **Conditions tab** in the field settings.
* Choose a display mode — **Show** or **Hide**.  
  – The **Pro version** adds two more modes: **Enable/Disable**, letting you control input availability conditionally.
* Add a condition by entering the **Field ID** to compare values. Example: show the **"Order ID"** field if `query-type = order-status`.
* Apply multiple conditions using the **AND operator** (all conditions must match).  
  – The Pro version also supports **OR operator** logic. Learn more in the [AND/OR conditions guide](https://docs.coolplugins.net/doc/and-or-conditional-logic-elementor-form/?utm_source=cfef_plugin&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=docs&utm_content=installation).
* Use comparison operators like **equals (==), not equals (!=), greater than (>), less than (<)**.  
  – The Pro version adds advanced operators: **>=, <=, contains, does not contain, starts with, ends with, empty, not empty**. See the full list of [supported operators](https://docs.coolplugins.net/doc/elementor-form-conditional-logic-operators/?utm_source=cfef_plugin&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=docs&utm_content=installation).

#### Step 4:
Save or update the page and preview the form to see the conditions in action.
