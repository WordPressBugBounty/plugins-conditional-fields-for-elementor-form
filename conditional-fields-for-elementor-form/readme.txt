Add conditional fields to Elementor forms and apply if-else conditional logic to show or hide Elementor form fields using dynamic rules.

== Description ==

**Using Elementor forms but unable to apply conditional logic on form fields?**

The **[Conditional Fields for Elementor Form](https://coolplugins.net/product/conditional-fields-for-elementor-form/?utm_source=cfef_plugin&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=get_pro&utm_content=top_name)** plugin helps you apply **conditional logic** to Elementor form fields. You can hide, show, enable, or disable fields dynamically based on input values from other form fields.

*Basically, it uses **"If condition"** logic. For example, if condition A is true, then field XYZ will be visible; otherwise, it remains hidden within the Elementor form.*

The **Elementor Pro form widget** does not provide built-in functionality for **conditional logic** on its form fields. With the help of this powerful **Elementor addon**, you can enable conditions to hide or show a field based on values entered in other fields.

**Compatibility:** You can use this **ultimate addon** to apply visibility logic on **Elementor Pro** and **Hello Plus** form widget fields.

### Conditional Fields Features

* **Show / Hide Fields Conditionally**  
 Easily add conditional logic to show or hide any field within an **Elementor form** based on values from other fields. You can currently add conditions to these field types: **text, textarea, email, telephone, URL, radio, select, file upload, HTML, number, and checkbox**.

* **If / Else Logic Without Code**  
 Apply if/else logic to form fields without writing any code. Simply add the ID of the field on which you want to base the condition. For example, if the "Query Type" field ID is "query_type," you can set it to show the "Enter Order ID" field if `query_type == check-order-status` and hide it otherwise.

* **Apply Multiple Conditions**  
 Apply multiple conditions to a form field, with actions triggered only if all conditions are met (using AND logic).

* **No Validation Errors**  
 Avoid validation errors when a required field is hidden due to a condition.

* **Compatibility with Hello Plus**  
 The Conditional Fields for Elementor Form plugin is fully compatible with the Hello Plus plugin’s Form Lite widget, which you can use inside Elementor Free.

== Installation ==

### Quick Installation

1. Go to **"wp-admin >> Plugins >> Add New"** in your WordPress dashboard, search for **"Conditional Fields for Elementor Form"**, and install and activate the plugin developed by [Cool Plugins](https://coolplugins.net/?utm_source=cfef_plugin&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=author&utm_content=installation).
2. Install **Elementor Pro** to access this plugin’s features, since the Elementor Pro form widget is required.  
   – If you are only using Elementor Free, you can still apply conditional logic by using the **Hello Plus Form Lite widget**.
3. Edit a page with Elementor and create a form. In the Elementor form widget, you’ll find a **Conditions tab** where you can add rules to hide, show, enable, or disable fields. For step-by-step instructions, check the [getting started guide](https://docs.coolplugins.net/doc/apply-conditional-logic-on-elementor-form-fields/?utm_source=cfef_plugin&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=docs&utm_content=installation).

### How to Add Conditional Logic to Elementor Form Fields?

#### Step 1:
First, install **Elementor Pro** (or Hello Plus for Elementor Free), then install **[Conditional Fields for Elementor Form](https://coolplugins.net/product/conditional-fields-for-elementor-form/?utm_source=cfef_plugin&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=get_pro&utm_content=installation)**.  

Since this is an addon for Elementor forms, Elementor Pro or Hello Plus must be installed first.

#### Step 2:
After installation, edit a page with Elementor where you want to add a form. Create the form using the Elementor form widget and add your desired fields.

#### Step 3:
Select the field you want to show, hide, enable, or disable based on conditions.

* **Example:** In a contact form, show the **"Order ID"** field only if the user selects **"Order Status"** in the dropdown, and hide it if **"General Query"** is selected.
* Enable conditions via the **Conditions tab** in the field settings.
* Choose a display mode — **Show** or **Hide**.  
  – The **Pro version** adds two more modes: **Enable/Disable**, letting you control input availability conditionally.
* Add a condition by entering the **Field ID** to compare values. Example: show the **"Order ID"** field if `query-type = order-status`.
* Apply multiple conditions using the **AND operator** (all conditions must match).  
  – The Pro version also supports **OR operator** logic. Learn more in the [AND/OR conditions guide](https://docs.coolplugins.net/doc/and-or-conditional-logic-elementor-form/?utm_source=cfef_plugin&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=docs&utm_content=installation).
* Use comparison operators like **equals (==), not equals (!=), greater than (>), less than (<)**.  
  – The Pro version adds advanced operators: **>=, <=, contains, does not contain, starts with, ends with, empty, not empty**. See the full list of [supported operators](https://docs.coolplugins.net/doc/elementor-form-conditional-logic-operators/?utm_source=cfef_plugin&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=docs&utm_content=installation).

#### Step 4:
Save or update the page and preview the form to see the conditions in action.

Add conditions to Elementor form fields to hide or show a form field based on inputs from other fields, using if-else conditional logic.

== Description ==

**[Conditional Fields for Elementor Form](https://coolplugins.net/product/conditional-fields-for-elementor-form/?utm_source=cfef_plugin&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=get-pro&utm_content=plugin-name)** is an addon for Elementor that helps you apply conditional logic to Elementor form fields. You can hide or show fields based on the input values from other form fields.

**Elementor Pro does not support conditional logic inside its form widget fields, so we created Conditional Field addon. It provides you with the option to enable conditions on Elementor form fields, allowing you to hide or show a form field based on the inputs from other fields.**

### PLUGIN FEATURES
— —————————————- —

* **[Show / Hide Fields Conditionally](https://coolplugins.net/product/conditional-fields-for-elementor-form/?utm_source=cfef_plugin&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=get-pro&utm_content=view-demos#demos)**
 Easily add conditional logic to show or hide any field within an Elementor form based on values from other fields. Currently, you can add conditions to these fields: **text, textarea, email, telephone, URL, radio, select, file upload, HTML, number, and checkbox.**

* **If / Else Logic Without Code**
 Apply if/else logic to form fields without coding. Simply add the ID of the field through which you want to apply a condition. For example, if the "Query Type" field ID is "query_type," you can set it to show the "Enter Order ID" field if "query_type == check-order-status" and hide it otherwise.

* **Apply Multiple Conditions**
 Apply multiple conditions to a form field, and actions will be triggered if all conditions are met, using AND logic.

* **No Validation Errors**
 You will not encounter validation errors if a required field is hidden due to a condition.

* **Compatibility with Hello Plus**
 The Conditional Fields for Elementor Form plugin is now fully compatible with the Hello Plus plugin. This means you can easily show or hide specific form fields based on user selections in forms built inside Elementor Free.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

### Which operators can I use to compare conditional field values?
You can trigger conditions on a field by comparing values with several operators:

* **is equal (==), not equal (!=), greater than (>), less than (<)** - These are available in the free version.
* The Pro version supports additional operators: **greater than or equal to (>=), less than or equal to (<=), contains, does not contain, empty, not empty, starts with, ends with**.

### On which form fields can I apply conditions?
You can apply conditions on these fields on Elementor form: **text, textarea, email, tel, radio, select, file upload, HTML, and checkbox**.

### Can I hide/show or disable/enable a form field conditionally?
In the free version, you can hide or show form fields based on conditional triggers. The Pro version also allows you to enable or disable fields conditionally.

### How can I apply multiple conditions on Elementor form fields?
You can add multiple conditions to a form field and trigger them using **AND/OR logic**:

* **AND** means all conditions must be met to trigger an action on that field.
* **OR** logic, which triggers an action if any condition is met, is available in the Pro version of the [Conditional Fields For Elementor](https://coolplugins.net/product/conditional-fields-for-elementor-form/?utm_source=cfef_plugin&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=get-pro&utm_content=faqs-and-or) plugin.

== Installation ==

### Quick Installation

1. Navigate to **"wp-admin >> Plugins >> Add New"** on your WordPress website, search for **"Conditional Fields for Elementor Form"**, and install and activate this plugin developed by [Cool Plugins](https://coolplugins.net/?utm_source=cfef_plugin&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=homepage).
2. Install **"Elementor PRO"** to access this plugin’s features, as the form widget is only available in the Elementor Pro version.
3. Edit a page with Elementor and create a form. In the form fields, you’ll find a conditions tab where you can easily apply conditions.

### How to Add Conditions to Elementor Form Fields?

#### Step 1:
First, install **"Elementor Pro"**, then install **"[Conditional Fields for Elementor Form](https://coolplugins.net/product/conditional-fields-for-elementor-form/?utm_source=cfef_plugin&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=get-pro&utm_content=installation)"**. Since it is an addon for Elementor Pro, Elementor Pro must be installed first.

#### Step 2:
After installing both plugins, edit a page with Elementor where you intend to add a form. Create the form using the Elementor form widget and add the desired fields.

#### Step 3:
Select the field you wish to hide or show based on specific conditions.

* For example, in a contact form, you might want to show the **"Order ID"** field only if the user selects **"Order Status"** in a query-type select/option field, and hide it if **"General Query"** is selected.
* Enable conditions on a field via the **"conditions tab."**
* Choose a display mode, either **hide or show**. For example, if you select **"Show"**, the field remains hidden until the condition is met. Conversely, the **"Hide"** option keeps the field visible until the condition is met. The pro version of this addon adds two more modes: **Enable/Disable**, allowing you to enable or disable an input field based on conditions.
* Create a condition by entering the ID of the field against which you want to compare the value. For example, you might enable a condition on the **"Order ID"** field so it becomes visible if **"query-type = order-status"**.
* You can also apply multiple conditions to a field and link them using an **AND operator**, meaning the field will hide or show if all conditions are met. The pro version also supports an **OR operator**, allowing a field to hide/show if any condition is met.
* Conditions can be compared in several ways, such as **is equal to (==), is not equal to (!=), greater than (>), and less than (<)**. The pro version supports many other comparison conditions like **empty, not empty, contains, does not contain, starts with, ends with**, etc.

#### Step 4:
Save or update the page and see the results and actions!
